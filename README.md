# Open-Pose-Live-Tracker-Single-Person-with-Visualizationv2
This project uses MediaPipe's Pose solution to detect and visualize human body keypoints in real-time from a webcam feed. It processes the video frames to identify landmarks and draw connections between them, displaying the results with customized styling. The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.
